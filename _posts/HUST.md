In 2014 Summer, I was admitted by Huahzong University of Science and Technology, one of the Top 10 Chinese Universities. 
By the time I entered the college, I held the strong belief that the future computational structure would be highly inspired 
by biology. Therefore, I chose bioinformatics as my undergraduate major. 
However, after one year's study, I realized the huge gap between the current stage of bioinformatics and the ideal future I 
conceived. And computer science and statistics are the core impetus to push bioinformatics ahead.
