In Spring 2015, I was totally attractted by the educational system of U.S. Universities. I noticed the opportunity to
change my major by joining one of the U.S. Universities. From Summer 2015, I started preparing all the materials from 
scratch, and in Fall 2015, I was successfully admitted by Rutgers University. I luckily declared my major as two of my 
favorate subjects: mathematics and computer science. My next goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in the area of data science, 
and particular focus on using my computational skill to solve societal and healthcare issues.
